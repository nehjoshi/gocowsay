# üêÆ gocowsay

A Go-powered clone of `cowsay` that prints your messages in a speech balloon followed by an ASCII cow. Easily pipe in text from tools like [`fortune`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man6/fortune.6.html), or supply your own message!

```
$ fortune | gocowsay

## üöÄ Installation

### ‚úÖ Option 1: `go install` (Quickest)

```bash
go install github.com/nehjoshi/gocowsay/cmd/gocowsay@latest
```

Make sure your `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin` is in your `PATH`. If not, add it to `~/.bashrc` by adding the following line to the end of the file:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/go/bin:$PATH"
```

Then run:

```bash
fortune | gocowsay
```

If the installation fails, you may not have Go or Fortune installed on your system. If so, go to Option #4 to resolve this.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Option 2: Clone & Run Locally (Development)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nehjoshi/gocowsay.git
cd gocowsay
echo "hello world" | go run ./cmd/gocowsay
```

To build a local binary:

```bash
go build -o gocowsay ./cmd/gocowsay
./gocowsay < message.txt
```
---

### üê≥ Option 3: Run with Docker

If you don't want to install Go, you can run `gocowsay` using Docker. Use the following series of commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nehjoshi/gocowsay.git
cd gocowsay
docker build -t gocowsay .
```

---

### Option 4: Use ```setup.sh``` (Recommended for Ubuntu)
1. Download or copy the ```setup.sh``` file to your machine.
2. Make the script executable (only needed once):
```bash
chmod u+x setup.sh
```
Run the script to automatically install all required dependencies and set up the project:
```bash
./setup.sh
```
This script is designed for Ubuntu-based distributions and will install Go (if missing), update your ```PATH```, install fortune, and build the project.

## üêß Usage Examples

```bash
echo "hello world" | gocowsay
